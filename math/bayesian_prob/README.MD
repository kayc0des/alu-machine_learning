# Bayes Theorem

Bayes' Theorem, named after 18th-century British mathematician Thomas Bayes, is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probability. Conditional probability is the likelihood of an outcome occurring, based on a previous outcome having occurred in similar circumstances. Bayes' theorem provides a way to revise existing predictions or theories (update probabilities) given new or additional evidence.
