Write a class Neuron that defines a single neuron performing binary classification (Based on 2-neuron.py):

Add the public method def cost(self, Y, A):
Calculates the cost of the model using logistic regression
Y is a numpy.ndarray with shape (1, m) that contains the correct labels for the input data
A is a numpy.ndarray with shape (1, m) containing the activated output of the neuron for each example
To avoid division by zero errors, please use 1.0000001 - A instead of 1 - A
Returns the cost
