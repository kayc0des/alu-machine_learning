Write a class NeuralNetwork that defines a neural network with one hidden layer performing binary classification (based on 13-neural_network.py):

Add the public method def train(self, X, Y, iterations=5000, alpha=0.05):
Trains the neural network
X is a numpy.ndarray with shape (nx, m) that contains the input data
nx is the number of input features to the neuron
m is the number of examples
Y is a numpy.ndarray with shape (1, m) that contains the correct labels for the input data
iterations is the number of iterations to train over


Updates the private attributes __W1, __b1, __A1, __W2, __b2, and __A2
You are allowed to use one loop
Returns the evaluation of the training data after iterations of training have occurred
