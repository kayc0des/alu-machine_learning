# Neural Style Transfer

Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take three images, a content image, a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter), and the input image you want to style - and blend them together such that the inpur image is transformed to look like the content image, but 'painted' in the style of the style image.

The principle of neural style transfer is to define two distance functions, one that describes how different the content of two images are, Lcontent, and one that describes the difference between the two images in terms of their style, Lstyle. Then, given three images, a desired style image, a desired content image, and the input image (initialized with the content image), we try to transform the input image to minimize the content distance with the content image and its style distance with the style image.

In summary, we’ll take the base input image, a content image that we want to match, and the style image that we want to match. We’ll transform the base input image by minimizing the content and style distances (losses) with backpropagation, creating an image that matches the content of the content image and the style of the style image.
